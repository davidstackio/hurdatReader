hurdatReader
============
Python code to read and analyze the Atlantic basin hurricane database (HURDAT)
provided by NOAA. See http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat

TO RUN:
1. Install Python 3.2
   There are no special python modules used in this program.
2. Run main.py in 'hurdatReader' folder.
3. All files will be created in the 'output' folder.
4. The 'data' folder contains the original HURDAT database downloaded from
   http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/tracks1851to2010_atl_2011rev.txt
   
Disclaimer: This code was created by David Stack for a project in the
Introduction to Scientific Computing class at Chapman University during the
fall of 2011. Feel free to use the code to read and analyze the HURDAT
database, but be aware that I have no plans to update it in the future.
